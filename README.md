# Spree/MailChimp Integration

[![Build Status](https://app.wercker.com/status/03e07999926ddaf022b4ad7ec6460f27/s "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/03e07999926ddaf022b4ad7ec6460f27)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/DynamoMTL/spree_chimpy.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/DynamoMTL/spree_chimpy)

Makes it easy to integrate your [Spree][1] app with [MailChimp][2].

**List Synchronization**
> Automatically syncs Spree's user list with MailChimp. The user can
> subscribe/unsubscribe via the registration and account pages.

**Order Synchronization**
> Fully supports MailChimp's [eCommerce360][3] API. Allows you to create
> targeted campaigns in MailChimp based on a user's purchase history.  We'll
> even update MailChimp if the order changes after the sale (i.e. order
> modification, cancelation, return). Users who check out with their email in
> the Spree Storefront will accrue order data under this email in MailChimp.
> This data will be available under the 'E-Commerce' tab for the specific
> subscriber.

**Campaign Revenue Tracking**
> Notifies MailChimp when an order originates from a campaign email.

**Custom User Data**
> Easily add your own custom merge vars. We'll only sync them when data changes.

**Existing Stores**
> Provides a handy rake task `rake spree_chimpy:orders:sync` to sync up all
> your existing order data with mail chimp. Run this after installing
> spree_chimpy to an existing store.

**Deferred Processing**
> Communication between Spree and MailChimp is synchronous by default. If
> you're using `delayed_job`, the communication is queued up and deferred to
> one of your workers. (`sidekiq` support also planned).

**Angular.js/Sprangular**
> You can integrate it
> with [sprangular](https://github.com/sprangular/sprangular) by using
> [sprangular_chimpy](https://github.com/sprangular/sprangular_chimpy).

## Installing

Add spree_chimpy to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'spree_chimpy'
```

Alternatively you can use the git repo directly:

```ruby
gem 'spree_chimpy', github: 'DynamoMTL/spree_chimpy', branch: 'master'
```

Run bundler:

    bundle

Install migrations & initializer file:

    bundle exec rails g spree_chimpy:install

### MailChimp Setup

If you don't already have an account, you can [create one here][4] for free.

Make sure to create a list if you don't already have one. Use any name you like, just don't forget to update the `Spree::Chimpy::Config#list_name` setting.

### Spree Setup

Edit the initializer created by the `spree_chimpy:install` generator. Only the API key is required.

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree_chimpy.rb
Spree::Chimpy.config do |config|
  # your API key provided by MailChimp
  config.key = 'your-api-key'
end
```

If you'd like, you can add additional options:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree_chimpy.rb
Spree::Chimpy.config do |config|
  # your API key as provided by MailChimp
  config.key = 'your-api-key'

  # name of your list, defaults to "Members"
  config.list_name = 'peeps'

  # change the double-opt-in behavior
  config.double_opt_in = false

  # send welcome email
  config.send_welcome_email = true

  # id of your store. max 10 letters. defaults to "spree"
  config.store_id = 'acme'

  # define a list of merge vars:
  # - key: a unique name that mail chimp uses. 10 letters max
  # - value: the name of any method on the user class.
  # default is {'EMAIL' => :email}
  config.merge_vars = {
    'EMAIL' => :email,
    'HAIRCOLOR' => :hair_color
  }
end
```

When adding custom merge vars, you'll need to notify MailChimp by running the rake task: `rake spree_chimpy:merge_vars:sync`

For deployment on Heroku, you can configure the API key with environment variables:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree_chimpy.rb
Spree::Chimpy.config do |config|
  config.key = ENV['MAILCHIMP_API_KEY']
end
```

### Segmenting

By default spree_chimpy will try to segment customers. The segment name can be configured using the `segment_name` setting.
Spree_chimpy will use an existing segment if it exists. If no segment can be found it will be created for you automatically.

#### Note about double-opt-in & segmenting

Mailchimp does not allow you to segment emails that have not confirmed their subscription. This means that if you use the
double-opt-in setting users will not get segmented by default. To work around this there is a rake task to segment all currently subscribed users.

`rake spree_chimpy:users:segment`

The output of this command will look something like this:

    Segmenting all subscribed users
    Error 215 with email: user@example.com
     msg: The email address "user@example" does not belong to this list
    segmented 2 out of 3
    done

You can run this task recurring by setting up a cron using [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) or by using [clockwork](https://github.com/tomykaira/clockwork). Alternatively when you host on Heroku you can use [Heroku Scheduler](https://addons.heroku.com/scheduler)

### Adding a Guest subscription form

spree_chimpy comes with a default subscription form for users who are not logged in, just add the following deface override:

```ruby
Deface::Override.new(:virtual_path  => "spree/shared/_footer",
                     :name          => "spree_chimpy_subscription_form",
                     :insert_bottom => "#footer-right",
                     :partial       => "spree/shared/guest_subscription")
```

The selector and virtual path can be changed to taste.
